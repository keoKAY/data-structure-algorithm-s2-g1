### Data Structure ? 
Structuring Data 


There are two types of data structure
1. Linear Data Structure 
2. Non-Linear Data Structure 


### Algorithm 
a Step-by-step process in solving specific coding problem .


### Measuring the algorihtm by time. 
mili = 10^-3 
micro = 10^-6

1000 ms = 1sec 
1000000 microseconds  = 1secs 


## There are differnt type of O notation 
O(1)
O(n)
O(n^2)
O(log n )
O(n log n)
O(n!)

n! = 1*2*3*.....*n
