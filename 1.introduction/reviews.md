**Data Structure** = 
a Ways to structure the data ( store and organize the data )

***
**Non-Linear Structure** : Tree , Graph
**Linear Data Structure** : 
Array, Stack , Queue, LinkedList 
Contiguous Memory Location 
[0x1000,0x1004,0x1008]

Program = Data Structure + Algorithm 

**Algorithm** 
- a step by step process in solving specific coding problem. 

Solution Mathematic = 
- Fast 
- Correct! 


[+] To compare or describe the algorihtm: 
- Correctness 
- Efficiency 
    - Time Complexity ( Time executed as input size growth)
    - Space Complexity ( Memory taken as input size growth)

**The Best Algorithm**: 
- Spent Less Time (FAST )
- Spent less Memory (Less RAM )
> There are always  **Trade-off** 

*** 
**The Best Algorithm** : Algorithm that solve your problem
Algorihtm follow your constraints and goals
> with your hardward spec, what algorithm to use 

*** 
Notation is a symbol or way to represent things 
Assymtotic Notation: 
1. **Big O** 
- upper-bound 
- worst-case senario 

> Can be used describe both **Time and Space Complexity** 
2. Omega : best-case 
3. Theta : average
